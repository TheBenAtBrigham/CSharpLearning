## Overview


This software is made to print "Hello, world" in English and in Japanese as two strings each using the C-Sharp method of Console.WriteLine(*string here*).

The purpose of creating this software is to refresh skills in programming in C-Sharp, by starting with printing simple strings and utilizing a developer interface that allows debugging of the code based on .NET structuring.

## Development Environment

This program was created as a Console App in Visual Studio Code with the extensions of .NET, C#, and C# Dev Kit. 

The language I used to make this program is C-Sharp with some elements of .NET to run the code by debugging and running it.
